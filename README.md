# Simple date based versioning to Laravel API Form Requests and Rerouces

**THIS PACKAGE IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT**

This Laravel package is a proof of concept and inspired of Stripe's [blog post about API versioning](https://stripe.com/blog/api-versioning)

Rather than having large major API versions (v1, v2, v3...) the updates are small and named with the date they are released. This package tries to solve issue when it comes breaking change in Laravel From Requests (for example validation rules) and Laravel Resources.

API resources are written so that the structure they describe is what
weâ€™d expect back from the current version of the API. When we need to
make a backwards-incompatible change we release new date based API version
that will describe how to revert the change.

Example of how versions and changes are described.
```
return [
                '2018-06-05' => [], // Latest version doesn't have any changes naturally. Doesn't have to be defined here.
                '2018-05-28' => [
                    'App\Http\Resources\BookResource' => 'App\Http\Resources\Changes\UpdatePublishedDate',
                    'App\Http\Requests\StoreBook'     => 'App\Http\Requests\Changes\\MakeAuthorNonMandatory',
                ],
                '2018-05-26' => [
                    'App\Http\Resources\BookResource' => 'App\Http\Resources\Changes\AddAuthor',
                    'App\Http\Resources\FooResource'  => 'App\Http\Resources\Changes\Bar',
                ],
        ];
```
